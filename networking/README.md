# Marc's networking cheat sheets

I have made a couple of networking videos on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/onemarcfifty) but sometimes I really forget stuff and need to watch my own videos again - doh! Thought I'd gradually build up a repo of cheat sheets on how to do certain things - even though you could probably easily google them.

## want to contribute ?

- send me a pull request here on Github
