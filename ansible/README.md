# Marc's ansible playbooks

I use ansible to automate or rather manage a couple of things in my network:

- deploy ansible
- deploy zabbix
- enable syslog forwarding
- lockdown access on OpenWrt devices

the scripts do take variables (in fact I use rundeck as a GUI for ansible which is a nice way to define variables for a step)
